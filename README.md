My Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, education, and experience as a developer and student. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site features a clean, responsive interface and includes sections about me, my technical skills, education timeline, project highlights, open-source contributions, and contact information.

Features:

About Me: Brief introduction and background

Skills: A summary of my technical abilities

Education: Timeline of my academic journey

Projects: Highlights of my completed and ongoing projects

Open Source: Details of my contributions to open-source initiatives

Contact: Ways to get in touch for collaboration or freelance work

The portfolio is continuously updated as I learn new technologies and complete new projects. Feel free to explore the code
